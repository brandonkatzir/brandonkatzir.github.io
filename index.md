I am the Systems and Discovery Librarian at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. I graduated from the School of Library and Information Science at the University of Oklahoma in 2022. I also graduated with a Ph.D in English from Louisiana State University in 2017. Prior to working at Smith, I worked as a Digital Services Librarian at Oklahoma State University and an Assistant and Associate Professor of English at Oklahoma City University. 

I'm interested in systems and discovery, data and research data management, and optimizing the academic library for the needs of 21st century researchers.
